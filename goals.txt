NOW:  
    Build  out popular ad-cards 2x6 grid, with refresh button (improvement) vs infinite scroll 
    (impossible to get to footer)

LATER:
    - setup the links and refactor routes

Find Public API with dummy data or create dummy api with Mirage.js(custom json user object-data)?
Functionality..

Hard challenges for later:
add user accounts with auth and login
users can chat in live chat system? 


API - dummy products:

fetch('https://dummyjson.com/products')
.then(res => res.json())
.then(console.log);

THEN TRANSLATE ALL DATA w/3rd party library
