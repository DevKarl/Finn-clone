NOW:  
    IMPROVEMENT IDEA: REPLACE INFINITE SCROLL W/FIXED 2x6 GRID W/REFERSH BTN 
    --> because: impossible to get to footer on landing page!
    Build  out popular ad-cards 2x6 grid, add btn, connect to API (make redux store)


LATER:
    - setup the links and refactor routes

Find Public API with dummy data or create dummy api with Mirage.js(custom json user object-data)?
Functionality..

Hard challenges for later:
add user accounts with auth and login
users can chat in live chat system? 


API - dummy products:

fetch('https://dummyjson.com/products')
.then(res => res.json())
.then(console.log);

make call to API with 30 RANDOM products 

THEN TRANSLATE ALL DATA w/3rd party library

- Go through entire design, and refactor based on guidelines (PDF design theory):
    - typography: font size, letter-spacing, line height, dont center text etc.(footer)
    - colors: color system: palette: main colors& grey color(shades and tints), maybe accent color(different)?, 
      no full-black colors, text not too light(contrast ratio), try OpenColors tool, subtile hover&active effects on btns (lighter),
